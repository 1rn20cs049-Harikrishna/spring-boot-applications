## Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run".

#### Features
- Create stand-alone Spring applications
- Embed Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow directly (no need to deploy WAR files)
- Provide opinionated 'starter' dependencies to simplify your build configuration
- Automatically configure Spring and 3rd party libraries whenever possible
- Provide production-ready features such as metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration
- Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration

 #### To manually initialize the project:

1. Navigate to https://start.spring.io. This service pulls in all the dependencies you need for an application and does most of the setup for you.

2. Choose either Gradle or Maven and the language you want to use. This guide assumes that you chose Java.

3. Click Dependencies and select Spring Web.

4. Click Generate.

5. Download the resulting ZIP file, which is an archive of a web application that is configured with your choices.
